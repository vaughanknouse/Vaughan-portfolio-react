## Description \*\*\* <!-- omit in toc -->

My portfolio project built with React.js showcasing my work as a Full-Stack Web Developer, featuring projects built with modern web technologies, a responsive design, and a user-friendly interface.

This portfolio website is designed to give an in-depth look at my skills, experience, and past projects. The site is structured with a clean, modern aesthetic, featuring a responsive design to provide an optimal viewing experience across various devices. Each section of the website provides valuable information for prospective clients, collaborators, or employers, showcasing my skills in front-end and back-end development, my proficiency with development tools, and my experience in the healthcare sector.

The project follows a modular approach, with each section clearly defined and styled to ensure a consistent user experience. My goal with this portfolio is to highlight both my technical abilities and my dedication to creating impactful, user-centered web applications.
